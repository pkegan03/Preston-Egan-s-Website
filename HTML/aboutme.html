        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am originally from Spokane, Washington, and I am currently a pre-business student at 
            Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I take pride in giving my full effort to everything I 
            take on. School, work, and personal projects all matter to me, and I try to approach each one with 
            commitment, purpose, and a willingness to work hard.
        </p>

        <p>
            I grew up with three sisters who have influenced the way I communicate, support others, and work 
            as part of a team. Two of my sisters are married, and my oldest sister has a young son named Bennett 
            who brings a lot of energy to our family. My younger sister, Haylie, currently lives in 
            Provo, and being close to her has strengthened my appreciation for family and meaningful 
            relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sports have been a major part of my life. I enjoy playing and watching football and lacrosse, and 
            I value the discipline, teamwork, and resilience that athletics teach. I stay active through weight 
            training and use fitness as a way to stay mentally sharp and physically healthy.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also have a strong interest in photography and digital design. I enjoy creating clean and structured 
            visual content, and I often look for ways to blend creativity with technology. Whether I am designing 
            a webpage or capturing photos that tell a story, I like producing work that feels intentional and 
            meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Personal growth is important to me. I try to learn from every experience and look for opportunities 
            to improve my skills and contribute to the people and projects around me. I want to bring integrity, 
            effort, and a positive attitude into every environment I am part of.
        </p>
